# Mr Ong and the valuable lesson he taught us

## Part 1- Introduction 
Mr Ong first taught us at the end of Term 1 before Circuit Breaker started.  He was our science teacher.  Our first impressions of him were that he was a great teacher.  He was very funny and had many witty jokes to tell us.  He could teach the science concepts effectively.  He was also kind and patient, willing to help any of us who needed help with any science concepts.

## Part 2- Fateful first science experiment
One science lesson, we were at the science lab with Mr Ong, conducting a science experiment.  During the washing up, a few of our classmates began to mix some chemicals together without Mr Ong's instructions.  When Mr Ong spotted them, he exploded.  He shouted at the top of his lungs "1H!"  Never had we seen him so angry before.  When he calmed down, he explained to us that the science lab was a dangerous place and we should not mess around as we could get ourselves hurt.  Mixing chemicals may also produce danerous results, he explained, and we learnt an important lesson on lab safety that day.
